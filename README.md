# My Learning and Studying Resources

## Obsidian Vault
The "Notes" folder is an obsidian vault containing all of my written notes; as well as some pdfs of related content.

To view these notes, you must open the folder using obsidian.
Some content may not be formatted properly if you aren't using the same plugins or settings that I am.
